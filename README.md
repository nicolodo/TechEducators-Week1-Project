🎯 What requirements did you achieve?
    🎯 Ensure each section of the webpage is wrapped in the correct semantic tags, ensuring that includes a <header>, <nav>, and <footer>.
        I wrapped top bar with a header, placed the links in a flexbox nav, and
        there is a footer at the end of the page where contact info might be.
    🎯 Implement CSS absolute positioning to overlay text on an image or another element.
        Yes I used a position absolute on a div within a position:relative div.
        In order to position it at the bottom left of each of the feature boxes.
    🎯 Utilise CSS Flexbox to create a flexible and responsive layout, particularly in the <nav> element.
        Yes, there are a series of links, which are separated for visual ease
    🎯 Ensure all image elements (<img>) and background images are correctly implemented with accurate file paths.
        There are no image elements but the file paths for the background are right.
        I could move them into their own image or resources folder. but the 
        current one works
🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
        I haven't tried the stretch goals yet. but I think I can do the 
        scroll to top. You could use a <a> tag pointing to a point on the page
🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
        Wasn't one I didn't do, but I found placing the cta boxes difficult.
        It helps to know now that positon:absolute goes from the first
        positioned box.
